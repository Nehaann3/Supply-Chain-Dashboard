# SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

## OVERVIEW
This project features an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze supply chain performance using a dataset focused on order fulfillment and customer delivery metrics. The dashboard provides insights into order processing, on-time delivery, and volume fill rates, covering data from a  period with key metrics tracked across customers and cities.

## FEATURES
### Key Metrics: Displays total orders (32K), order lines (57K), orders on time (9K), total order quantity (13M), total delivered quantity (12.97M), and undelivered quantity (458K).
### Performance KPIs: Highlights on-time (OT) percentage (5.93% vs. goal 86.09%), in-full (IF) percentage (52.78%), line item fill rate (LIFR) (65.96%), and volume fill rate (VOFR) (96.59%).
### Customer Analysis: Breaks down performance by customer  and identifies delays .
### City Analysis: Compares OT% and IF% across cities against targets.
### Supply Chain Insights: Visualizes average order cycle time (0.42 days) and average delay (1.69 days), with a breakdown of delay distribution (e.g., 6.4K orders delayed by 1 day).
